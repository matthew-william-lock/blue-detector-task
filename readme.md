# blue-detector-task

This repository contains the code for the Blue Detector Task. The task is defined as follows:

> Develop an appropriate system including ROS/Pythonâ€‹ that will prevent operation of a linear actuator if enough color "blue" is detected on an RGB video camera. The delivery should include CAD for the complete system (actuator, camera and anything else relevant). Please carefully review the job description and make sure you are showing your work at your best. Think about the use cases, how we'll read your code, your architecture, and how your solution might break. A single code file is not likely to be sufficient. You can of course make assumptions/simplifications, but state them clearly.
